the limits. The key is to understand the limits and see if we can come up with interesting products that could continue to serve the Chinese market. We don't have anything at the moment, but we're considering it. We're thinking about it. Obviously, the limits are quite stringent at the moment. And we have nothing to announce today. And when the time comes, we'll engage the administration and discuss that. Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst (Jake for Aaron): Hi. This is Jake on for Aaron. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the great quarter. I was wondering if you could give some additional color around the strength you saw within the networking business, particularly around the adoption of your Ethernet solutions at CSPs as well as any change you're seeing in network attach rates. Jensen Huang: Yeah, thank you for that. We now have three networking platforms, maybe four. The first one is the scale-up platform to turn a computer into a much larger computer. Scaling up is incredibly hard to do. Scaling out is easier to do, but scaling up is hard to do. And that platform is called NVLink. NVLink is -- comes with it chips and switches and NVLink Spines and it's really complicated. But anyway, that's our new platform, scale-up platform. In addition to InfiniBand, we also have Spectrum-X. We've been fairly consistent that Ethernet was designed for a lot of traffic that are independent, but in the case of AI, you have a lot of computers working together. And the traffic of AI is insanely bursty. Latency matters a lot because the AI is thinking and it wants to get work done as quickly as possible, and you got a whole bunch of nodes working together. And so, we enhanced Ethernet, added capabilities like extremely low latency, congestion control, adaptive routing, the type of technologies that were available only in InfiniBand to Ethernet. And as a result, we improved the utilization of Ethernet in these clusters. These clusters are gigantic, from as low as 50% to as high as 85%, 90%. And so, the difference is if you had a cluster that's $10 billion, and you improve its effectiveness by 40%, that's worth $4 billion. It's incredible. And so, Spectrum-X has been really, quite frankly, a home run.
