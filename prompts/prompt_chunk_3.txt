three of them together finally, and we're going to market with that. And then lastly, industrial AI. Remember, one of the implications of the world reordering, if you will, is a region's onshoring manufacturing and building plants everywhere. In addition to AI factories, of course, there are new electronics manufacturing, chip manufacturing being built around the world. And all of these new plants and these new factories are creating exactly the right time when Omniverse and AI and all the work that we're doing with robotics is emerging. And so, this fourth pillar is quite important. Every factory will have an AI factory associated with it. And in order to create these physical AI systems, you really have to train a vast amount of data. So, back to more data, more training, more AIs to be created, more computers. And so, these four drivers are really kicking into turbocharge. Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot.

He has a vision and I trust him. With respect to our export controls, it's a set of limits. And the new set of limits pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further for any productive use. And so, the new limits, it's kind of the end of the road for Hopper. We have some -- we have limited options. And so, we just -- the key is to understand
