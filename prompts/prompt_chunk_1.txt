Operator: Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open. Ben Reitzes: Yeah, hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask, first to Colette, just a little clarification around the guidance and maybe putting it in a different way. The $8 billion for H20 just seems like it's roughly $3 billion more than most people thought with regard to what you'd be foregoing in the second quarter. So, that would mean that with regard to your guidance, the rest of the business in order to hit $45 billion is doing $2 billion to $3 billion or so better. So, I was wondering if that math made sense to you. And then, in terms of the guidance, that would imply the non-China business is doing a bit better than the Street expected. So, wondering what the primary driver was there in your view. And then, the second part of my question, Jensen, I know you guide one quarter at a time, but with regard to the AI diffusion rule being lifted and this momentum with sovereign, there's been times in your history where you guys have said on calls like this, where you have more conviction and sequential growth throughout the year, et cetera. And given the unleashing of demand with AI diffusion being revoked and the supply chain increasing, does the environment give you more conviction in sequential growth as we go throughout the year? So, first one for Colette and then next one for Jensen. Thanks so much. Colette Kress: Thanks, Ben, for the question. When we look at our Q2 guidance and our commentary that we provided, that, had the export controls not occurred, we would have had orders of about $8 billion for H20, that's correct. That was a possibility for what we would have had in our outlook for this quarter in Q2. So, what we also have talked about here is the growth that we've seen in Blackwell, Blackwell across many of our customers as well as the growth that we continue to have in terms of supply that we need for our customers. So, putting those together, that's where we came through with the guidance that we provided. I'm going to turn the rest over to Jensen to see how he wants to take us. Jensen Huang: Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Ben. I would say compared to the beginning of

Four Key Growth Drivers: NVIDIA highlights four main pillars driving growth—AI infrastructure, AI factories (industrial AI), new chip manufacturing plants, and robotics integration with their Omniverse platform. These are positioned as turbocharging NVIDIA’s business expansion.

Geopolitical and Export Control Challenges: The company faces stringent U.S. export controls restricting advanced product shipments to China (especially the Hopper GPU). NVIDIA is actively assessing alternative product options and engaging with authorities but currently has no new products for China under these constraints.

Networking Business Strength: NVIDIA is growing its networking segment with multiple platforms (NVLink, InfiniBand, Spectrum-X, BlueField). Particularly, Spectrum-X improves Ethernet cluster efficiency significantly, enabling cost savings and enhanced performance for AI workloads.

Product Adoption and Enterprise Readiness: Major cloud service providers are adopting Spectrum-X, and NVIDIA’s BlueField solutions support multi-tenant, high-performance secure clusters, indicating a strong position in data center networking.

AI Market Expansion: AI inference workloads are surging rapidly, outpacing previous platform shifts like mobile and cloud. NVIDIA’s Grace Blackwell and DGX systems are ready to support full AI lifecycle needs from training to inference and reasoning agents at scale.

Sovereign, Enterprise, and Industrial AI: NVIDIA is positioning itself across multiple AI sectors:

Sovereign AI infrastructure as governments invest heavily

Enterprise AI for on-prem/cloud hybrid deployments, modernizing existing IT infrastructures

Industrial AI powering next-gen factories, digital twins, and robotics with Omniverse and Isaac GR00T

Outlook and Growth Wave: The company is entering a powerful new growth phase with multiple significant engines fueling revenue, innovation, and market leadership.
